abstract = {Today's popular IEEE 802.11b (802.11b) for wireless local area networks (WLANs) has changed the face of networking, providing tremendous flexibility for mobile workers and hassle-free Internet sharing for home users. The next milestone in the evolution of WLANs is the introduction of IEEE 802.11g (802.11g). This new IEEE standard will dramatically improve the performance of WLANs, while providing compatibility with the existing installed base of 802.11b networks. The purpose of this white paper is to: • Provide an explanation of existing WLAN standards • Describe 802.11g specification requirements • Set expectations for 802.11g performance • Discuss 54g™, the high performance implementation of the 802.11g standard WLAN MARKET The WLAN market has grown rapidly as wireless technology has evolved to meet fundamental needs of businesses and technology consumers alike: • Corporate IT departments deploy WLANs to support roving employees, reduce the cost of cabling and recabling the physical plant, and provide a rapid response to changes in demand. • The mobile worker uses public access WLANs in cafes, airports, trains, lobbies, and remote corporate sites to connect to the corporate network or Internet. • Small offices and enterprises use WLANs to share Internet connections, printers and peripherals, and create backup connectivity solutions while remaining highly scalable and flexible, without the costs of cabling. • The home customer uses a WLAN to share a broadband Internet connection among multiple family PCs without drilling holes and installing cable throughout the home. These customers have adopted WLAN solutions to achieve flexibility, connectivity, mobility, and low-cost deployments not available through conventional wired solutions. The numbers speak for themselves—over 35 million WLAN nodes have already shipped and the number of nodes is expected to grow to 100 million in 2005.},

Furthermore, HomePlug GP specifications target broadband applications such as in-home distribution of low data rate IPTV, gaming, and Internet content, while Wi-Fi is directed at computer-to-computer connections as an extension or substitution of cabled networks. In this paper, we provide a study of these six wireless communication standards, comparing their main features and behaviors in terms of various metrics, including the transmission time, modulation type, and power consumption.

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

abstract = {We studied germination of two halophytic species at different salinity concentrations and their recovery of germination in great salinities. Salicornia showed high germination rates at low salinity in front of Arthrocnemum. For both species, germination was delayed with increase of salinity until 3{\%}. Recovery experiments and tetrazolium test show that exposure to high salinity does not harm seeds and that exposure to high salinity stimulates germination of the seeds of Arthrocnemum macrostachyum. Our results about viability and seed bank suggest a different behaviour because of ecological connotations. These connotations are highly influenced by the life cycle of each species.

@article{Ventura2011,
abstract = {The halophyte Salicornia was recently introduced as a fresh vegetable crop that thrives in extreme salt conditions. Two annual Salicornia and two perennial Sarcocornia ecotypes were investigated for yield production and nutritional value in response to different seawater concentrations in the irrigation solution. A harvest schedule based on a three-week cycle gave better productivity than a two-week or a four-week cycle. Total yield declined with increasing percentage of seawater above 50{\%} in the irrigation water, however annual plants had always ca 2-3-fold higher fresh biomass in comparison to their perennial counterparts. Increased percentages of seawater in the irrigation solution had the following effects on ion concentrations in the shoots: no change in Ca2+ and Mg2+, a slight increase in K+, and marked elevations in Na+ and Cl-. Importantly, total polyphenol, $\beta$-carotene and ureides, all known for their antioxidant capacities, rose with increasing seawater percentage, findings that indicated improved nutritional values for Salicornia and Sarcocornia irrigated with high concentrations of seawater. Impressively, both the annual Salicornia and the perennial Sarcocornia ecotypes exhibited high total shoot lipid contents of up to 2.41 and 2.06mgg-1 fresh weight, respectively, which included an omega-3 fraction of 47.6 and 41.2{\%} of the total fatty acid content. Moreover, the high fatty acid content of the annual Salicornia ecotype was not significantly affected by increasing seawater concentrations. In this study, we thus demonstrated the feasibility of cultivating Salicornia and Sarcocornia by applying a multiple harvest system and 100{\%} percentages of seawater in the irrigation water generating economic yields with high nutritional value. The findings also showed that Salicornia and Sarcocornia leafy vegetables may attract additional interest as an alternative source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for human consumption, even when the crop irrigated solely with seawater. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Field and greenhouse studies have been conducted to clarify aspects of population dynamics and NaCl tolerance of Salicornia ramosissima J. Woods. Two populations, Varela and Verdemilho, were monitored in the field during two consecutive life cycles and aspects of their morphology and density were recorded monthly. In the laboratory seedlings were exposed to different salinity for 10 weeks and growth and mortality rate were recorded weekly. The growth of the populations differed significantly, possibly because of the different salinities of the two sampling sites and/or genetic adaptations of the two populations to the environmental conditions. The absence of a significant correlation between sediment salinity and stem elongation suggested, however, that salinity, alone was not responsible for the differences observed and was possibly associated with other factors, because of nutritional, edaphic, and microclimatic conditions. S. ramosissima did not develop well in conditions of elevated or moderate salinity; its growth was optimum at low salinity. Optimum development of S. ramosissima may, nevertheless, depend on the total number of large seeds in a population seed bank, because of their greater success in germination and germinability under stress conditions than small seeds.},

differences between$\backslash$ndifferent populations, and between different generations, of S.$\backslash$nramosissima for the distribution pattern, morphology and NaCl$\backslash$ntolerance; nitrate accumulation patterns in different organs and their$\backslash$nrelation to salt tolerance; degree of accumulation of nutrients in the$\backslash$nplants and in the surrounding sediment; the role played by the plants$\backslash$nin the retention and immobilisation of heavy metals.$\backslash$nSeven sampling sites were selected in the salt marsh areas of$\backslash$nthe main branches of Ria de Aveiro. Sampling of the species studied$\backslash$nwas undertaken every month for one annual cycle. Several plant$\backslash$nparts were collected (roots, stems, leaves and/or articles), as well as$\backslash$nthe sediment surrounding them.$\backslash$nSeveral parameters were determined in the sediment, namely$\backslash$nwater content, pH, Eh, salinity, organic matter content, the$\backslash$nconcentrations of the ions sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium$\backslash$nand of the heavy metals zinc, lead, cadmium, iron and copper.$\backslash$nIn the plant material, the following parameters were$\backslash$ndetermined: morphological characters, such as the colour and$\backslash$ndiameter of the articles, succulence of leafs and segments, and the$\backslash$naccumulation, in different organs, of the ions nitrate, chloride, sodium,$\backslash$npotassium, calcium, magnesium and the same heavy metals$\backslash$nanalysed in the sediment.$\backslash$nAs a complement to sampling, some morphological$\backslash$nparameters of S. ramosissima were measured in the field for two$\backslash$nconsecutive annual cycles, namely colour and height of the plants,$\backslash$nnumber of nodes in the main stem, number of branches, diameter of$\backslash$nthe branching area, and population density. In addition, seedlings$\backslash$nwere brought into the laboratory, submitted to different salinities for$\backslash$nten weeks in greenhouse conditions, and their height and number of$\backslash$nbranches registered weekly.$\backslash$nThe following conclusions were drawn:$\backslash$n• the species S. perennis subsp. perennis and H. portulacoides$\backslash$nshowed greater morphological variability than S. ramosissima;$\backslash$n• Salicornia ramosissima developed better in low salinity, but$\backslash$naccumulated a greater amount of chloride and sodium ions;$\backslash$n• morphological variability is also under the control of sediment$\backslash$n10$\backslash$nairing, population density and competition, both intra- and interspecific;$\backslash$n• the weak correlation between the availability of ions in the$\backslash$nsediment and ion accumulation in the plants suggests that the$\backslash$nphysiology of these species is more important than the environmental$\backslash$nconditions;$\backslash$n• moderate amounts of heavy metals are retained in the$\backslash$nsediments of the sampling sites selected for this study, especially in$\backslash$nthose near the sources of pollution;$\backslash$n• the studied species seem able to regulate the absorption of$\backslash$nheavy metals, and they may be used as biomonitors for the amount$\backslash$nof metal ions available for the plants, although not for their$\backslash$nconcentration in the sediment;$\backslash$n• this study points out the importance of salt marshes for the$\backslash$ndecontamination of estuarine and lagunar ecosystems, due to the$\backslash$nretention of some metals in the sediments and in vascular plants.},

It differs from other species of Salicornia by (1) the central flower of the dichasia being fused to the main axis of the spike, and (2) the comparatively long anthers in combination with short inflorescen-ces. Only two localized populations are known, from saline clays on the banks of a salt lake. S. heterantha shows a peculiar heterocarpy: fruits of lateral flowers are dispersed freely while the fruit of the central flower remains fixed to the spike.},
